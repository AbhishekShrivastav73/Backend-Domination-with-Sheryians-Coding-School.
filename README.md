# How Internet Works.

## Basics 

In this lesson, we'll take a deep dive into the fascinating world of the internet. We'll explore how data travels across the globe, from your device to servers and back again. You'll learn about protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, which form the backbone of the internet. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of the infrastructure that powers the internet and how information is transmitted between devices. Let's unravel the mysteries of the internet together!

### How Internet Works ? 
The internet connects devices worldwide through a network of cables and servers. When you request a webpage, your device sends data to your <mark>Internet Service Provider (ISP) </mark>, which then routes it to the server hosting the page. The server sends the data back, and your device displays the webpage. This happens quickly, enabling global communication.
### Understanding IP Address ?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to each device on the internet. It works like a home address, telling other devices where to send data, such as websites or emails. Each device needs an IP address to communicate and share information online.(IP is provided by the ISP)

### What is MAC Address ? 
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network hardware, like a Wi-Fi card or Ethernet adapter. Think of it as a serial number for your device's internet connection hardware. When devices communicate within a local network, the MAC address helps ensure that the information goes to the correct device. Unlike IP addresses, which can change, MAC addresses are usually fixed and assigned by the manufacturer.

#### IP addresses are used to route the data across networks globally, while MAC addresses are used to ensure the data reaches the correct device within a local network. This combination allows data to travel from your laptop to your friend's computer accurately.

### Understanding VPN 
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, creates a secure connection between your device and the internet. It works by routing your internet traffic through a private server, hiding your real IP address and encrypting your data. This makes your online activities more private and secure, protecting you from hackers and allowing you to access content that might be restricted in your location. Essentially, a VPN acts like a secure tunnel for your internet traffic.

### Servers 
A server is a powerful computer that provides services and resources to other computers, called clients, over a network. Servers store and manage data, run applications, and handle requests from clients. For example, when you visit a website, your computer sends a request to the server hosting that site. The server processes the request and sends the webpage back to your computer. Servers can manage many tasks simultaneously and are essential for running websites, email, online games, and many other services on the internet.

## A server is a computer system connected to the internet, programmed to process, store, and provide data to other computers.

## More Information 

In this lesson, we'll simplify what reverse proxies are and how they work. Think of a reverse proxy as a shield that stands between the internet and your web servers, protecting them from direct access. We'll explore how reverse proxies enhance security, improve performance, and streamline network traffic. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of how reverse proxies can benefit your online infrastructure. Let's dive in and uncover the secrets of reverse proxies together!

### Proxy
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your internet requests go to the proxy server first, which then forwards them to the target website. The website's response goes back to the proxy, which sends it to you. This process hides your IP address, making your online activity more private and allowing you to access blocked or restricted content. Proxies can also improve security and manage network traffic.

### Reverse Proxy 
A reverse proxy sits between the internet and a server, acting as a middleman for incoming requests. When someone tries to access a website, the reverse proxy receives the request first, then forwards it to the appropriate server. It then sends the server's response back to the user. This helps balance the load among multiple servers, improves security by hiding the server's identity, and can cache content to speed up access for users. Essentially, a reverse proxy manages and protects server resources while providing efficient user access.

### Internet Protocols 
Internet protocols are rules and standards that allow devices to communicate over the internet. They ensure data is sent and received correctly between devices. Common protocols include HTTP for accessing websites, FTP for transferring files, and TCP/IP, which ensures data is properly routed and reaches its destination. These protocols work together to enable seamless and reliable communication across the global internet.

### ISP (Internet Service Provider)
An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company that provides you with access to the internet. When you connect to the internet from home or on your mobile device, your ISP routes your data to and from websites and online services. They manage your internet connection, handle network traffic, and offer various services like email and web hosting. Without an ISP, you wouldn't be able to connect to the internet.

### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, and it is the foundation of internet communication. TCP ensures that data is sent and received accurately by breaking it into packets and reassembling it at the destination. IP handles addressing and routing these packets to the correct destination. Together, TCP/IP makes sure that data travels efficiently and reliably between devices across networks, enabling everything from web browsing to email to online streaming.

### UDP -(User Datagram Protocol)
UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a communication method used on the internet. Unlike TCP, UDP sends data without establishing a connection or checking for errors. This makes it faster but less reliable, as data packets can be lost or arrive out of order. UDP is ideal for applications where speed is crucial and some data loss is acceptable, like live video streaming, online gaming, and voice calls.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. When you type a website address into your browser, HTTP is the protocol used to request the web page from the server, and it also defines how the server sends the web page back to your browser.

## Everthing about Node JS
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a web browser. It's used to build fast and scalable server-side applications, thanks to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This makes it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps and online gaming.

### Non-blocking I/O
Non-blocking I/O is a way of handling input and output operations without making the program wait. Instead of stopping to wait for data to be read or written, the program can continue doing other tasks. When the data is ready, the program gets a notification and processes it. This approach helps make programs faster and more efficient, especially when dealing with many tasks at once.

### Libuv in NodeJs
##### Non-blocking or async nature of the Node js is just because of the Libuv
Libuv is a key component in Node.js that handles the event loop and manages asynchronous operations. It provides the foundation for non-blocking I/O by abstracting the underlying operating system's asynchronous features, such as file system operations, networking, and timers. When Node.js performs an asynchronous task, like reading a file, Libuv takes care of running the task in the background and notifies Node.js when the task is complete. This allows Node.js to keep processing other tasks without waiting, making it efficient and fast for handling multiple operations simultaneously.

### Node JS Single Threaded Architecture 
Node.js is single-threaded, which means it uses a single thread to handle all tasks. However, it can handle many tasks at once because of its event-driven, non-blocking nature. Here's an easy-to-understand explanation with an example:

Imagine you are a waiter in a busy restaurant, and you are the only one taking orders (the single thread). Instead of waiting by each table until the food is ready, you quickly take an order from one table, pass it to the kitchen (non-blocking), and move on to the next table to take another order. While you’re taking more orders, the kitchen (event loop) is preparing the food. When the food is ready, the kitchen notifies you, and you deliver it to the table (callback function).

In this way, even though you are just one person (single-threaded), you efficiently handle many tables (tasks) at the same time. Node.js works similarly by using the event loop to manage multiple operations without waiting for each one to finish before starting the next.

# NPM 
NPM, or Node Package Manager, is a tool that comes with Node.js. It helps you easily install, share, and manage packages (reusable pieces of code) that other developers have written. With NPM, you can quickly add new features to your project without writing everything from scratch. It also helps you manage project dependencies and keep your code organized.

## File Handling in Node JS

File handling in Node.js involves reading from, writing to, and managing files on your system. Node.js provides the `fs` (file system) module to perform these operations. Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Reading Files**: You can read files using methods like `fs.readFile` for asynchronous reading and `fs.readFileSync` for synchronous reading.
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(data);
   });
   ```

2. **Writing Files**: You can write to files using methods like `fs.writeFile` for asynchronous writing and `fs.writeFileSync` for synchronous writing.
   ```javascript
   fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello, World!', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('File has been written');
   });
   ```

3. **Appending Files**: You can add content to an existing file using `fs.appendFile` for asynchronous appending.
   ```javascript
   fs.appendFile('example.txt', ' More content', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Content added');
   });
   ```

4. **Deleting Files**: You can delete files using `fs.unlink`.
   ```javascript
   fs.unlink('example.txt', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('File deleted');
   });
   ```

5. **Other Operations**: The `fs` module also allows you to rename files, read directories, and perform many other file-related operations.

By using these methods, Node.js allows you to handle files efficiently in both synchronous and asynchronous ways.

<hr/>

Handling folders (directories) in Node.js involves operations like creating, reading, renaming, and deleting directories. The `fs` (file system) module in Node.js provides methods for these operations:

1. **Creating Directories**: You can create directories using `fs.mkdir`.
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   fs.mkdir('newFolder', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Directory created');
   });
   ```

2. **Reading Directories**: You can read the contents of a directory using `fs.readdir`.
   ```javascript
   fs.readdir('.', (err, files) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Files in the current directory:', files);
   });
   ```

3. **Renaming Directories**: You can rename directories using `fs.rename`.
   ```javascript
   fs.rename('newFolder', 'renamedFolder', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Directory renamed');
   });
   ```

4. **Deleting Directories**: You can delete directories using `fs.rmdir`.
   ```javascript
   fs.rmdir('renamedFolder', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Directory deleted');
   });
   ```

These methods allow you to manage directories in your file system, enabling you to organize and manipulate folder structures as needed within your Node.js applications.

## HTTP Module in NODE JS
The `http` module in Node.js allows you to create web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides a way to build applications that can communicate over the web. Here’s a simple example of how to use the `http` module to create a basic web server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Create a server object
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Send the response body
    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

// The server listens on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

In this example:
1. We require the `http` module.
2. We create a server using `http.createServer`, passing a callback function that handles incoming requests (`req`) and sends responses (`res`).
3. The server listens on port 3000, and when accessed, it responds with "Hello, World!".

This basic setup allows you to handle more complex routing and functionality, making the `http` module a powerful tool for building web applications with Node.js.
# Express Domination 
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building web and mobile applications. It provides a set of tools and features to create robust APIs and web servers easily. With Express.js, you can handle routing, manage HTTP requests and responses, and use middleware to add extra functionality. It's lightweight, flexible, and widely used, making it easier for developers to build and manage server-side applications efficiently.

Express.js is built on top of Node.js and simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. Here are the basic concepts and components of Express:

1. **Routing**: Express uses a routing mechanism to map different URL paths to specific functions. This allows you to define what should happen when a user visits a particular URL.
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
       res.send('About Page');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
   });
   ```

2. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
       console.log('A request was made at:', new Date());
       next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
   });
   ```

3. **Request and Response Objects**: Express extends the request and response objects from Node.js to provide useful methods for handling HTTP requests and responses. For example, `req.query` to access query string parameters and `res.send` to send a response.
   ```javascript
   app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
       res.send(`User ID: ${req.query.id}`);
   });
   ```

4. **Template Engines**: Express can integrate with various template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars to generate dynamic HTML pages.
   ```javascript
   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
   
   app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
       res.render('profile', { name: 'John Doe' });
   });
   ```

5. **Static Files**: You can serve static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the `express.static` middleware.
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

6. **Handling Form Data**: Express makes it easy to handle form data by parsing request bodies with middleware like `body-parser` or the built-in `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

   app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
       res.send(`Form Data: ${req.body.name}`);
   });
   ```

These basics allow you to create robust web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently with Express.

## Middlewares
 Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
       console.log('A request was made at:', new Date());
       next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
   });
   ```
### Express-Session Middleware 
Express-session is a middleware in Express.js that helps you manage user sessions. A session allows you to store data about a user's interaction with your application across multiple requests. This is useful for keeping users logged in, storing preferences, and tracking user activities. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Installation**: First, you need to install the `express-session` package.
   ```bash
   npm install express-session
   ```

2. **Setup**: You need to set up the session middleware in your Express app.
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const session = require('express-session');
   const app = express();

   app.use(session({
       secret: 'yourSecretKey', // A secret key to sign the session ID cookie
       resave: false,           // Prevents saving the session if it wasn't modified
       saveUninitialized: true  // Forces a session that is "uninitialized" to be saved
   }));
   ```

3. **Using Sessions**: Once set up, you can use `req.session` to store and retrieve session data.
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       if (req.session.views) {
           req.session.views++;
           res.send(`Number of views: ${req.session.views}`);
       } else {
           req.session.views = 1;
           res.send('Welcome to this page for the first time!');
       }
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
   });
   ```

In this example:
- When a user visits the homepage, the server checks if there is a `views` property in their session.
- If it exists, it increments the view count and displays it.
- If not, it sets the `views` property to 1 and welcomes the user for the first time.

This way, sessions help you keep track of user interactions across multiple requests, making it easier to build features like login systems and user preferences.

## Connect-Flash : 
**Connect-Flash** is a middleware for Node.js that allows you to store temporary messages (flash messages) in a session. These messages can be used to display notifications, alerts, or any other messages to the user after they perform an action (e.g., form submission, login, etc.). The messages are cleared after being displayed once.

### Basic Code Example

1. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install express-session connect-flash
   ```

2. **Set up the middleware in your Express app:**

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const session = require('express-session');
   const flash = require('connect-flash');

   const app = express();

   // Set up session middleware
   app.use(session({
     secret: 'yourSecretKey',
     resave: false,
     saveUninitialized: true,
   }));

   // Set up connect-flash middleware
   app.use(flash());

   // Example route to set a flash message
   app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
     req.flash('info', 'Login successful!');
     res.redirect('/dashboard');
   });

   // Example route to display flash message
   app.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
     const message = req.flash('info');
     res.send(message); // This will display 'Login successful!'
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

### How It Works

- When the user visits `/login`, a flash message is stored using `req.flash('info', 'Login successful!')`.
- The user is then redirected to `/dashboard`, where the message is retrieved and displayed using `req.flash('info')`.
- The message is automatically cleared after being retrieved.

This way, flash messages are useful for displaying one-time notifications like success or error messages after form submissions or other actions.

## CORS : 

### What is CORS?

**CORS** stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**. It’s like a security guard for your web server. It controls who (which websites) can talk to your server and ask for data.

### Why Do We Need CORS?

Imagine you're on a website, and that site wants to get some data from another website (like an API). By default, your browser will block this because it doesn't know if the other website is trustworthy. This is where CORS comes in—it allows the server to say, "Hey, it's okay for this website to get my data."

### How Do You Use CORS in an Express App?

1. **Install the CORS package**:

   First, you need to install a package called `cors` that helps you handle this security rule in your Express app:

   ```bash
   npm install cors
   ```

2. **Set Up CORS in Your App**:

   Then, you add this `cors` package to your app so your server can decide which websites are allowed to access it:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');

   const app = express();

   // This line allows any website to access your server's data
   app.use(cors());

   // Example: A simple route that sends some data
   app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: 'Anyone can access this data!' });
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

### What Happens Now?

- **Without CORS**: Your browser would block any requests from other websites to your server, like a strict security guard.
- **With CORS**: You’ve told your server, "It’s okay, let other websites ask me for data." Now, those requests will go through.

### Limiting Access

If you want only a specific website (like `http://example.com`) to access your server, you can do this:

```javascript
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://example.com' }));
```

Now, only `http://example.com` can talk to your server, and all other websites will be blocked.

### In Simple Terms

CORS is like giving permission slips to websites, telling them whether they can talk to your server or not. The `cors` package in Express helps you easily manage these permissions.

## Cookie-Parser : 

**Cookie-Parser** is a middleware for Express that helps you manage cookies in your web applications. Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to the user's browser, which are stored and sent back to the server on subsequent requests. They are commonly used to track user sessions, remember login information, and store user preferences.

### What Does Cookie-Parser Do?

- **Reading Cookies**: When a request comes in, Cookie-Parser makes it easy to read and use the cookies that the browser sends with the request.
- **Setting Cookies**: It also simplifies the process of sending cookies back to the user's browser.

### How to Use Cookie-Parser in an Express App

1. **Install the `cookie-parser` package**:

   First, you need to install the `cookie-parser` package:

   ```bash
   npm install cookie-parser
   ```

2. **Set Up Cookie-Parser in Your App**:

   After installing, you add it to your Express app like this:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

   const app = express();

   // Use the cookie-parser middleware
   app.use(cookieParser());

   // Example: Set a cookie
   app.get('/set-cookie', (req, res) => {
     res.cookie('user', 'John Doe'); // Setting a cookie named 'user' with the value 'John Doe'
     res.send('Cookie has been set!');
   });

   // Example: Read a cookie
   app.get('/get-cookie', (req, res) => {
     const user = req.cookies['user']; // Reading the cookie named 'user'
     res.send(`User is: ${user}`);
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

### What Happens Here?

- **Setting a Cookie**: When the user visits the `/set-cookie` route, the server sends a cookie named `user` with the value `John Doe` to the user's browser. The browser stores this cookie.
- **Reading a Cookie**: When the user visits the `/get-cookie` route, the server reads the `user` cookie from the request (which the browser automatically sends). It then sends back the value stored in the cookie, which in this case is `John Doe`.

### In Simple Terms

- **Cookies** are like small notes that your server can give to a user's browser, saying things like "Remember this user" or "Keep track of this setting."
- **Cookie-Parser** helps you easily write and read these notes in your Express app. 

It's useful for things like remembering a user's login status or storing their preferences.

## Morgan:

**Morgan** is a middleware for Express that logs HTTP requests to your server. Think of it as a helpful tool that keeps track of every request made to your server and prints out details like what was requested, by whom, and how the server responded.

### Why Use Morgan?

Morgan is useful because it helps you see what's happening with your server in real-time. It’s like a diary that logs every interaction, which is great for debugging and monitoring your application.

### How to Use Morgan in an Express App

1. **Install the `morgan` package**:

   First, you need to install Morgan:

   ```bash
   npm install morgan
   ```

2. **Set Up Morgan in Your App**:

   After installing, you add it to your Express app like this:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const morgan = require('morgan');

   const app = express();

   // Use Morgan middleware with the 'tiny' format
   app.use(morgan('tiny'));

   // Example route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, world!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

### What Happens Here?

- **Logging Requests**: With `app.use(morgan('tiny'));`, Morgan logs basic details about every request to your server. For example, when someone visits your site, Morgan will log something like:

   ```
   GET / 200 9 - 0.080 ms
   ```

   This log entry shows:
   - `GET`: The HTTP method (could also be POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - `/`: The URL path requested.
   - `200`: The status code (200 means success).
   - The time it took to handle the request.

### In Simple Terms

- **Morgan** is like a security camera for your server. It watches every request that comes in and writes down what happened.
- It's great for keeping track of how your server is being used and for spotting any problems.

By using Morgan, you can easily see who is visiting your site, what they're doing, and how your server is handling their requests.

## Request and Response : 
In an Express.js application, `req` and `res` are two important objects that represent the **request** and **response** in a web server interaction. They are central to how your server handles incoming requests and sends back responses.

### `req` (Request Object)

The `req` object contains all the information about the incoming HTTP request. It's like a letter that someone sends to your server, and `req` holds all the details of that letter.

#### Key Properties of `req`:

- **`req.method`**: The HTTP method used for the request (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- **`req.url`**: The URL path of the request (e.g., `/about` or `/contact`).
- **`req.headers`**: An object containing the headers of the request (e.g., content type, user-agent).
- **`req.query`**: An object containing the query parameters in the URL (e.g., for `/search?q=term`, `req.query.q` would be `'term'`).
- **`req.body`**: The data sent in the request body (for `POST` or `PUT` requests). This usually contains form data or JSON payloads.
- **`req.params`**: An object containing route parameters (e.g., for `/user/:id`, `req.params.id` would contain the value passed in the URL).
- **`req.cookies`**: An object containing cookies sent by the client (requires middleware like `cookie-parser`).

### Example:

```javascript
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id; // Get the ID from the URL
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
```

Here, if the user visits `/user/123`, `req.params.id` will be `123`, and the server will respond with `User ID is 123`.

### `res` (Response Object)

The `res` object is what your server uses to send a response back to the client. It's like writing a reply letter and sending it back to the person who wrote to you.

#### Key Methods of `res`:

- **`res.send()`**: Sends a response back to the client. You can send text, HTML, JSON, etc.
- **`res.json()`**: Sends a JSON response. It automatically sets the content type to `application/json`.
- **`res.status()`**: Sets the HTTP status code for the response (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found).
- **`res.redirect()`**: Redirects the client to a different URL.
- **`res.render()`**: Renders a view template (e.g., using EJS, Pug, etc.).
- **`res.cookie()`**: Sets a cookie in the client’s browser (requires `cookie-parser` or similar middleware).

### Example:

```javascript
app.get('/welcome', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Welcome to our site!');
});
```

Here, when the user visits `/welcome`, the server responds with a `200` status and the message `'Welcome to our site!'`.

### In Simple Terms

- **`req`**: Think of it as the letter or message sent by the user to your server. It contains everything about what the user wants (like what page they want to see or what data they’re sending).
- **`res`**: This is your server's reply to the user. It’s what you send back to the user, like a response message, data, or an error code.

Together, `req` and `res` let you handle all kinds of interactions between the client (user) and your server.

## Dynamic Routing : 
---

## **What is Routing in Express.js?**

**Routing** in Express.js refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. It defines the various URLs (or paths) that your application can handle and what should happen when those URLs are accessed.

---

## **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**

- **Static Routing**: The route path is fixed and does not change. For example:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('About Us');
  });
  ```
  This route always responds to `/about`.

- **Dynamic Routing**: The route path can change dynamically based on parameters. It allows you to handle multiple routes with similar patterns. For example:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`User ID is ${req.params.userId}`);
  });
  ```
  This route can respond to `/users/1`, `/users/2`, etc., extracting the `userId` from the URL.

---

## **Understanding Dynamic Routing**

### **Route Parameters**

- **Route parameters** are parts of the URL that are variable. They are indicated by a colon (`:`) followed by a name.

**Example:**
```javascript
app.get('/products/:productId', (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.productId;
  res.send(`Product ID is ${productId}`);
});
```
- **Accessing Route Parameters**: Use `req.params` to access these parameters.
  - In the above example, if the user accesses `/products/123`, `req.params.productId` will be `'123'`.

### **Multiple Parameters**

You can have multiple dynamic segments in a route.

**Example:**
```javascript
app.get('/users/:userId/orders/:orderId', (req, res) => {
  const { userId, orderId } = req.params;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId} and Order ID is ${orderId}`);
});
```
- Accessing `/users/5/orders/99` will output: `User ID is 5 and Order ID is 99`.

---

## **Practical Examples**

### **Example 1: User Profile Route**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/profile/:username', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.params.username;
  res.send(`Welcome to ${username}'s profile!`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

**Usage:**
- Visiting `/profile/john` will display: `Welcome to john's profile!`
- Visiting `/profile/jane` will display: `Welcome to jane's profile!`

### **Example 2: Blog Post Route**

```javascript
app.get('/blog/:year/:month/:slug', (req, res) => {
  const { year, month, slug } = req.params;
  res.send(`Displaying blog post from ${month}/${year}: ${slug}`);
});
```

**Usage:**
- Visiting `/blog/2023/09/express-routing` will display: `Displaying blog post from 09/2023: express-routing`

---

## **Using Query Parameters with Dynamic Routes**

- **Query parameters** are additional data sent in the URL after a `?` symbol.
- They can be used alongside dynamic routes.

**Example:**
```javascript
app.get('/search/:category', (req, res) => {
  const category = req.params.category;
  const sortBy = req.query.sortBy; // e.g., ?sortBy=price
  res.send(`Searching in category: ${category}, sorted by: ${sortBy}`);
});
```

**Usage:**
- Visiting `/search/electronics?sortBy=price` will display: `Searching in category: electronics, sorted by: price`

---

## **Handling Optional Parameters**

- You can make route parameters optional by adding a `?` after the parameter name.

**Example:**
```javascript
app.get('/users/:userId/posts/:postId?', (req, res) => {
  const { userId, postId } = req.params;
  if (postId) {
    res.send(`Displaying post ${postId} for user ${userId}`);
  } else {
    res.send(`Displaying all posts for user ${userId}`);
  }
});
```

**Usage:**
- `/users/10/posts/5` => `Displaying post 5 for user 10`
- `/users/10/posts` => `Displaying all posts for user 10`

---

## **Using Regular Expressions in Routes**

- You can use regular expressions to define more complex route patterns.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Matches paths like /flight/AA123
app.get('/flight/:flightCode([A-Z]{2}[0-9]{3})', (req, res) => {
  const flightCode = req.params.flightCode;
  res.send(`Flight code is ${flightCode}`);
});
```

**Usage:**
- `/flight/AB123` => `Flight code is AB123`
- `/flight/abc123` => Does not match, results in 404 Not Found

---

## **Benefits of Dynamic Routing**

1. **Flexibility**: Handle a wide range of URLs with similar patterns without defining each one separately.
2. **Scalability**: Easily manage and extend routes as your application grows.
3. **Clean URLs**: Create user-friendly and SEO-friendly URLs.
4. **Simplified Code**: Reduce redundancy by capturing variable parts of the URL.

---

## **Summary**

- **Dynamic routing** allows your Express.js application to handle URLs that include variable data.
- Use **route parameters** (e.g., `:id`) to define parts of the URL that can change.
- Access these parameters via `req.params` inside your route handlers.
- Combine with **query parameters** for additional flexibility.
- You can also define **optional parameters** and use **regular expressions** for more control.

---

## **Complete Example**

Here's a small Express app demonstrating dynamic routing:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/products/:category/:productId', (req, res) => {
  const { category, productId } = req.params;
  res.send(`Category: ${category}, Product ID: ${productId}`);
});

app.get('/users/:userId?', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.userId;
  if (userId) {
    res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
  } else {
    res.send('User ID not provided');
  }
});

app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const { query, page = 1 } = req.query;
  res.send(`Searching for: ${query}, Page: ${page}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

**Testing the Routes:**
- `/products/electronics/123` => `Category: electronics, Product ID: 123`
- `/users/456` => `User ID is 456`
- `/users` => `User ID not provided`
- `/search?query=laptops&page=2` => `Searching for: laptops, Page: 2`

## Server side rendering with EJS : 

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** using **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** is a technique where the HTML content of a webpage is generated on the server before being sent to the client’s browser. This allows you to create dynamic web pages that can display different content based on the data processed on the server.

### What is Server-Side Rendering?

- **Server-Side Rendering** means that the server generates the full HTML for a webpage before sending it to the client. The browser then receives this HTML and displays it.
- This is different from **Client-Side Rendering** (CSR), where the server sends minimal HTML and JavaScript to the client, and the browser generates the full content dynamically on the client side.

### Why Use EJS for SSR?

**EJS** is a simple templating engine that lets you write HTML with embedded JavaScript. It makes it easy to create dynamic content by mixing HTML with data passed from the server.

### How to Use EJS for Server-Side Rendering

1. **Set Up Express and EJS**:

   First, you need to install Express and EJS:

   ```bash
   npm install express ejs
   ```

   Then, set up your Express application to use EJS as the templating engine:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Set EJS as the templating engine
   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

   // Example route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     const data = {
       title: 'Welcome to My Website',
       message: 'Hello, world!'
     };
     // Render the 'index.ejs' template and pass data to it
     res.render('index', data);
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

2. **Create an EJS Template**:

   Inside your project, create a folder called `views` and then create an `index.ejs` file inside it:

   ```html
   <!-- views/index.ejs -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title><%= title %></title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1><%= message %></h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **How It Works**:

   - **`res.render('index', data)`**: This tells Express to look for a file named `index.ejs` in the `views` folder, render it, and pass the `data` object to it.
   - **EJS Syntax**: Inside the EJS file, `<%= title %>` and `<%= message %>` are placeholders that get replaced with the actual data passed from the server.
   - **Generated HTML**: When the client requests the homepage (`/`), the server processes the EJS template, replaces the placeholders with the data values, and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client.

4. **Client Receives Rendered HTML**:

   When a user visits your website, the server sends the HTML generated from the EJS template. The browser then simply displays this HTML. No further processing or JavaScript is needed to display the content.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a blog, and you want to display a list of articles on the homepage. You can use SSR with EJS to dynamically generate the HTML for each article:

```javascript
app.get('/blog', (req, res) => {
  const articles = [
    { title: 'First Post', content: 'This is the first post.' },
    { title: 'Second Post', content: 'This is the second post.' }
  ];
  
  res.render('blog', { articles });
});
```

In your `blog.ejs` file:

```html
<!-- views/blog.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Blog Articles</h1>
    <ul>
        <% articles.forEach(article => { %>
            <li>
                <h2><%= article.title %></h2>
                <p><%= article.content %></p>
            </li>
        <% }); %>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### In Simple Terms

- **Server-Side Rendering with EJS**: The server generates the HTML for your webpage using EJS templates, fills in the dynamic parts with data, and then sends the complete HTML to the browser.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Faster initial load**: Since the HTML is pre-rendered, the page loads faster in the browser.
  - **Better SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl and index your content because it’s available in the HTML.
- **Dynamic Content**: You can use EJS to inject dynamic content into your web pages based on the data provided by your server, making your pages more interactive and personalized.

Server-Side Rendering with EJS is a straightforward and powerful way to build dynamic web pages that are fast and SEO-friendly.

## Form-Handling With EJS : 

Form handling in EJS (Embedded JavaScript) involves creating forms in your HTML templates, processing the data submitted by the user, and then responding based on that data. Here’s how you can handle forms using EJS with Express.js in the simplest way possible.

### Steps for Form Handling in EJS

1. **Create a Form in EJS**:
2. **Set Up Express to Handle Form Submissions**:
3. **Process the Form Data on the Server**:
4. **Respond Back to the Client**:

### Example: A Simple Contact Form

#### 1. Create a Form in EJS

First, create a simple form in your EJS template. Let’s assume you have a `contact.ejs` file where you ask the user for their name and message.

```html
<!-- views/contact.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Contact Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Contact Us</h1>
    <form action="/submit-form" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
        <br><br>
        <label for="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>
        <br><br>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Set Up Express to Handle Form Submissions

In your Express server, you need to set up routes to handle the form submission. Also, you need to parse the form data, which is usually done using the `express.urlencoded()` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse form data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Route to display the contact form
app.get('/contact', (req, res) => {
  res.render('contact'); // Renders the contact.ejs form
});

// Route to handle form submission
app.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
  const { name, message } = req.body; // Extract the form data
  res.send(`Thank you, ${name}. Your message: "${message}" has been received.`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### 3. Process the Form Data on the Server

- When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the `/submit-form` route using the POST method.
- `req.body` contains the form data (`name` and `message`) because of the `express.urlencoded()` middleware, which parses the incoming form data.

#### 4. Respond Back to the Client

- After processing the form data, you can send a response back to the client.
- In this example, the server sends a thank you message back to the user, displaying the name and message they submitted.

### What Happens Step by Step:

1. **User Visits Form**: The user visits the `/contact` page, and the `contact.ejs` form is rendered and displayed.
2. **User Submits Form**: The user fills in their name and message and clicks "Submit".
3. **Form Data is Sent**: The form data is sent to the server via a POST request to the `/submit-form` route.
4. **Server Processes Data**: The server extracts the data using `req.body`, processes it (if needed), and then sends a response back to the user.

### In Simple Terms

- **EJS Form**: You create an HTML form in an EJS file that sends data to the server when the user submits it.
- **Express Server**: The server listens for this data, processes it, and then responds based on the input.
- **Form Data**: The submitted form data is easily accessible in `req.body` and can be used to perform various actions, like saving to a database or simply responding with a message.

Form handling in EJS is a straightforward process where you combine your server-side logic with dynamic HTML templates to create interactive and user-friendly web pages.

## API (Application Programming Interface) : 
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests are made (like asking for data) and how responses are given (like sending data back).

For web apps, APIs use **HTTP methods**:
- **GET**: To fetch data.
- **POST**: To send new data.
- **PUT**: To update data.
- **DELETE**: To remove data.

APIs make it easier for different systems (like websites or apps) to interact and exchange information efficiently.

## Basic Error Handling in Express  :

**Error handling** is the process of managing errors in a program to prevent it from crashing and to provide meaningful feedback. In web development, you handle errors by catching them, logging them, and responding with appropriate messages or status codes.

In **Express.js**, a common way to handle errors is using middleware:

[Error Handler ko hamesha last me bnao]

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});
```

This catches any errors in the app and returns a response like "Something went wrong!" with a 500 status code.

## POSTMAN 

**Postman** is a popular tool used by developers to test APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to APIs and see the responses, making it easier to debug and test your backend services.

### Key Features of Postman:
- **Send Requests**: You can send requests to API endpoints and see the responses directly (in formats like JSON or XML).
- **Test API Endpoints**: You can check if an API is working correctly by sending data (like in POST requests) or fetching data (in GET requests).
- **Headers and Body**: You can add headers, authentication tokens, or data in the request body to simulate real API calls.
- **Save Requests**: Postman lets you save and organize requests into collections for easy re-use.

Postman is widely used to ensure APIs are functioning properly during development.

# File Based Project - Khatabook

# MongoDB 

**MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called **documents** instead of traditional tables like in SQL databases. It’s designed for handling large volumes of data and allows developers to store, query, and manage data easily.

### Key Features:
1. **Document-based**: Data is stored in collections of documents (similar to JSON objects). Each document can have different fields and structures, making it very flexible.
2. **Schema-less**: You don’t need to define a strict structure for your data, allowing for flexibility in how data is stored.
3. **Scalability**: MongoDB can handle large amounts of data and scale across multiple servers easily (horizontal scaling).
4. **High Performance**: It is optimized for fast querying and can handle large, complex datasets.
5. **Rich Query Language**: Supports advanced queries, indexing, and aggregation to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data.

### Example of a MongoDB Document:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
```

In MongoDB, collections store documents, and each document can have different fields, making it very flexible for dynamic data.

## Mongoose 

**Mongoose** is an **ODM (Object Data Modeling)** library for **MongoDB** and **Node.js**. It provides a way to define schemas for your MongoDB documents and interact with the database using models, making it easier to work with MongoDB in a structured way.

### Key Features of Mongoose:
1. **Schema Definition**: You can define strict schemas (structure) for your MongoDB collections, ensuring data consistency.
2. **Models**: Mongoose models are based on schemas and allow you to interact with MongoDB collections (e.g., create, read, update, and delete documents).
3. **Validation**: Mongoose provides built-in validation to ensure the data follows the schema rules before it’s saved to the database.
4. **Middleware**: You can use middleware (hooks) to perform actions before or after certain operations, like saving data.
5. **Query Building**: Mongoose allows complex query building and chaining methods for database operations.

### Example of Mongoose Usage:

1. **Define a Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   // Define a schema for a user
   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: String,
     age: Number,
     email: String
   });

   // Create a model based on the schema
   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
   ```

2. **Save Data to MongoDB**:
   ```javascript
   const newUser = new User({
     name: 'John Doe',
     age: 30,
     email: 'johndoe@example.com'
   });

   newUser.save()
     .then(() => console.log('User saved!'))
     .catch(err => console.log(err));
   ```

Mongoose simplifies working with MongoDB by providing structure and useful features like validation, middleware, and easier querying.

# CRUD Operation in MongoDB 

**CRUD** operations in MongoDB stand for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**, which are the basic operations you perform on a database. Here’s how these operations work in MongoDB, with examples:

### 1. **Create (Insert)**
This operation adds new data (documents) to a collection.

#### Example:
Using Mongoose, you can create (insert) a new document like this:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a schema for users
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  email: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create and save a new user
const newUser = new User({
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john@example.com'
});

newUser.save()
  .then(() => console.log('User created'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

In MongoDB, the `insertOne()` method can also be used directly to add documents to a collection.

### 2. **Read (Retrieve)**
This operation fetches data from the database. You can retrieve one document or many documents.

#### Example:
To retrieve (read) data from a MongoDB collection:

```javascript
// Find all users
User.find()
  .then(users => console.log(users))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));

// Find a user by name
User.findOne({ name: 'John Doe' })
  .then(user => console.log(user))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

In MongoDB, `find()` retrieves all documents, while `findOne()` retrieves just one.

### 3. **Update**
This operation modifies existing data. You can update one or multiple documents.

#### Example:
To update a document, you can use `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` in MongoDB, or `findByIdAndUpdate()` in Mongoose:

```javascript
// Update the age of a specific user
User.findByIdAndUpdate('userId', { age: 35 })
  .then(() => console.log('User updated'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

This updates the user's `age` field to `35` based on their ID.

### 4. **Delete (Remove)**
This operation removes documents from a collection.

#### Example:
To delete data from MongoDB, use `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()`:

```javascript
// Delete a specific user
User.findByIdAndDelete('userId')
  .then(() => console.log('User deleted'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

This removes the document with the specified ID from the collection.

### Summary of CRUD Operations:
- **Create**: Add new documents to the collection (e.g., `insertOne`, `save()`).
- **Read**: Fetch documents from the collection (e.g., `find()`, `findOne()`).
- **Update**: Modify existing documents (e.g., `updateOne()`, `findByIdAndUpdate()`).
- **Delete**: Remove documents from the collection (e.g., `deleteOne()`, `findByIdAndDelete()`).

These basic operations allow you to manage data in MongoDB efficiently.

# Advanced MongoDB Queries 

### 1. **`insertMany()`**
- **Purpose**: Adds multiple documents to a collection at once.
- **Usage**: Instead of inserting one document at a time, you can insert many documents in a single query, which improves performance.

#### Example:
```javascript
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }
];

await User.insertMany(users);
console.log('Documents inserted!');
```

### 2. **Comparison Operators**
These operators are used to compare values in MongoDB queries.

#### **`$eq`**: Equal
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field matches a specific value.
  
#### Example: Find users who are 25 years old
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $eq: 25 } });
```

#### **`$ne`**: Not Equal
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field **does not** match a specific value.

#### Example: Find users who are **not** 25 years old
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $ne: 25 } });
```

#### **`$gt`**: Greater Than
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is **greater than** the specified value.

#### Example: Find users older than 30
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } });
```

#### **`$gte`**: Greater Than or Equal To
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is **greater than or equal to** the specified value.

#### Example: Find users who are 30 or older
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $gte: 30 } });
```

#### **`$lt`**: Less Than
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is **less than** the specified value.

#### Example: Find users younger than 30
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $lt: 30 } });
```

#### **`$lte`**: Less Than or Equal To
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is **less than or equal to** the specified value.

#### Example: Find users who are 30 or younger
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $lte: 30 } });
```

### 3. **Array Operators**
These operators help you query documents with array fields.

#### **`$in`**: Matches Any Value in Array
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is present in an array of values.

#### Example: Find users whose age is either 25, 30, or 35
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $in: [25, 30, 35] } });
```

#### **`$nin`**: Not in Array
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field's value is **not** present in an array of values.

#### Example: Find users whose age is **not** 25, 30, or 35
```javascript
await User.find({ age: { $nin: [25, 30, 35] } });
```

### 4. **Field Operators**
These are operators that deal with field existence and other field-related conditions.

#### **`$exists`**: Field Exists or Not
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a field either exists or does not exist.

#### Example: Find users who have an `email` field
```javascript
await User.find({ email: { $exists: true } });
```

#### Example: Find users who **do not** have an `email` field
```javascript
await User.find({ email: { $exists: false } });
```

### 5. **Logical Operators**
Logical operators combine multiple conditions.

#### **`$and`**: Combine Multiple Conditions (All Must Match)
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where **all** conditions are true.

#### Example: Find users who are older than 25 **and** younger than 35
```javascript
await User.find({
  $and: [
    { age: { $gt: 25 } },
    { age: { $lt: 35 } }
  ]
});
```

#### **`$or`**: Combine Multiple Conditions (Any Can Match)
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where **any** of the conditions are true.

#### Example: Find users who are 25 **or** 35 years old
```javascript
await User.find({
  $or: [
    { age: 25 },
    { age: 35 }
  ]
});
```

### 6. **Regular Expression (`$regex`)**
- **Purpose**: Finds documents where a string field matches a regular expression pattern. Useful for pattern matching and partial string searches.

#### Example: Find users whose name starts with "Jo"
```javascript
await User.find({ name: { $regex: '^Jo', $options: 'i' } });
```
- `^Jo`: Finds names that start with "Jo".
- `$options: 'i'`: Makes the search case-insensitive (so it matches both "Jo" and "jo").

---

### Summary:
- **`insertMany()`**: Insert multiple documents at once.
- **`$eq`**, **`$ne`**, **`$gt`**, **`$gte`**, **`$lt`**, **`$lte`**: Compare values (equals, not equals, greater/less than).
- **`$in`**, **`$nin`**: Match values within arrays.
- **`$exists`**: Check if a field exists.
- **`$and`**, **`$or`**: Combine multiple conditions.
- **`$regex`**: Search by pattern (regular expressions).

These operators make it easy to write powerful queries that filter and find exactly the data you need in MongoDB.

# JOI 

**Joi** is a popular validation library for JavaScript that helps you validate and ensure the correctness of data in your applications, especially when working with forms or APIs. It's often used in frameworks like Express.js to validate data being sent to the server.

### Why Use Joi?
- **Data Validation**: Joi helps you ensure that the data follows the rules you define (e.g., an email should be in the correct format, age should be a number).
- **Error Handling**: If data doesn’t match the rules, Joi returns clear error messages, making it easy to handle invalid input.
- **Simplifies Validation**: Instead of writing custom validation logic for each field, you can use Joi to define schemas.

### Basic Concepts of Joi

1. **Schema Definition**: You define a "schema" that describes the structure and rules for your data (e.g., type, required fields, format).
2. **Validation**: You pass the data to the schema, and Joi checks if the data is valid.

### Example: Basic Joi Validation

#### Installation:
First, you need to install Joi via npm:
```bash
npm install joi
```

#### Basic Usage:

```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');

// Define a schema for user validation
const userSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().min(3).required(),    // 'name' must be a string with a minimum length of 3, and it's required
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),  // 'email' must be a valid email address and required
  age: Joi.number().min(18).max(65).required(),  // 'age' must be a number between 18 and 65
});

// Example data to validate
const userData = {
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  age: 25
};

// Validate the data
const { error, value } = userSchema.validate(userData);

if (error) {
  console.error('Validation error:', error.details);
} else {
  console.log('Validation success:', value);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Schema**: `userSchema` defines the structure of a valid user object.
  - `name` must be a string of at least 3 characters and is required.
  - `email` must be a valid email and is required.
  - `age` must be a number between 18 and 65 and is required.
  
- **Validation**: `userSchema.validate(userData)` checks the `userData` object against the schema.
  - If validation passes, `value` contains the valid data.
  - If validation fails, `error.details` contains information about what went wrong.

### Common Joi Validation Rules:
- **String**: `Joi.string()`
  - `.min(n)`: Minimum length.
  - `.max(n)`: Maximum length.
  - `.email()`: Validate email format.
  - `.regex(pattern)`: Match a regular expression pattern.
- **Number**: `Joi.number()`
  - `.min(n)`: Minimum value.
  - `.max(n)`: Maximum value.
  - `.integer()`: Must be an integer.
- **Boolean**: `Joi.boolean()`
- **Array**: `Joi.array()`
  - `.items(type)`: Define the type of items inside the array.
- **Date**: `Joi.date()`
  - `.greater(date)`: Must be after a certain date.
  - `.less(date)`: Must be before a certain date.

### Example: Validating an Array

```javascript
const schema = Joi.object({
  hobbies: Joi.array().items(Joi.string()).min(1).required()  // Array of strings, at least 1 item required
});

const data = { hobbies: ['reading', 'swimming'] };

const { error } = schema.validate(data);

if (error) {
  console.error(error.details);
} else {
  console.log('Validation passed!');
}
```

### Joi with Express.js
You can use Joi in Express.js to validate incoming request data (e.g., body, query, or params).

#### Example: Using Joi in Express.js

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Joi = require('joi');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // Parse incoming JSON data

// Define a schema for validation
const userSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().min(3).required(),
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  age: Joi.number().min(18).required()
});

// Route that accepts POST requests to create a new user
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  const { error } = userSchema.validate(req.body);

  if (error) {
    return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);  // Send error message if validation fails
  }

  res.send('User created successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

In this example, when a user sends a POST request to the `/user` endpoint, Joi validates the request body against the `userSchema`. If the data doesn't meet the requirements, it returns an error.

### Summary:
- **Joi** is a powerful and easy-to-use library for validating data.
- It allows you to define **schemas** to validate objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and more.
- It simplifies error handling by providing clear and structured error messages when validation fails.
- You can use Joi with frameworks like Express.js to ensure data being sent to your server is correct.

# Relationships In MongoDB 

In MongoDB, you can manage relationships between documents using two primary methods: **embedding** and **referencing**. Here’s a simple explanation of each:

---

### 1. **Embedding Documents**

In **embedding**, related data is stored **within the same document**. This is useful when the data is closely related and often accessed together.

#### Example: One-to-Many (User and their Posts)
Instead of creating a separate collection for posts, you embed the posts inside the user document:

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  posts: [
    {
      title: String,
      content: String,
      date: Date
    }
  ]
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Example document:
{
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  posts: [
    { title: "First Post", content: "Hello!", date: "2023-09-12" },
    { title: "Second Post", content: "MongoDB is great!", date: "2023-09-13" }
  ]
}
```

#### When to Use:
- When the related data is often accessed together.
- When the size of the embedded data is manageable (not too large).

#### Pros:
- **Fast retrieval**: All related data is in one document, requiring only one query.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to manage related data in one place.

#### Cons:
- **Document size**: If the embedded data grows (e.g., many posts), the document may become too large.
- **Redundancy**: Duplicating the same data in multiple places can lead to inconsistencies.

---

### 2. **Referencing Documents**

In **referencing**, related data is stored in **separate collections**, and the documents reference each other by using unique identifiers (like ObjectIDs). This is useful when data grows large or is frequently accessed independently.

#### Example: One-to-Many (User and their Posts)

Instead of embedding posts, we store them in a separate collection and reference them using their `ObjectId`.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  postIds: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' }]  // Array of post references
});

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  date: Date
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);

// Example user document:
{
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  postIds: ["613b1f8a6f92c20016d6e4c1", "613b1f8a6f92c20016d6e4c2"]
}
```

#### When to Use:
- When related data can grow large or is accessed separately.
- When you need to reference multiple documents from another collection (e.g., users and their posts).

#### Pros:
- **Scalability**: Can handle large amounts of related data (e.g., many posts).
- **Decoupled data**: Each piece of data (user, posts) can be managed and updated independently.

#### Cons:
- **Multiple queries**: Retrieving all related data (e.g., a user and their posts) requires more queries and `populate()` functions in Mongoose.
- **Slightly slower**: Fetching related data from multiple collections can slow down performance compared to embedded documents.

---

### Summary:
- **Embedding**: Store related data together in one document. Best for small, closely related data.
- **Referencing**: Store related data in separate collections and use references. Best for large or independent data

# Aggregation In MongoDB 

In MongoDB, **aggregation** is a powerful way to process and transform data. It allows you to perform operations like filtering, grouping, and calculating on the data stored in collections. The **aggregation framework** uses a pipeline concept, where documents are passed through a series of stages that transform them into a desired result.

### Key Aggregation Concepts:

- **Pipeline**: A series of stages that documents pass through. Each stage transforms the documents in some way.
- **Stages**: Operations like filtering (`$match`), grouping (`$group`), sorting (`$sort`), and more.

---

### Common Aggregation Stages:

1. **$match**: Filters documents based on certain criteria, similar to the `find()` method.
   ```javascript
   { $match: { status: "active" } }
   ```

2. **$group**: Groups documents by a field and performs aggregate calculations like `sum`, `count`, `avg`, etc.
   ```javascript
   {
     $group: {
       _id: "$category",  // Group by category field
       totalSales: { $sum: "$sales" }  // Calculate total sales for each category
     }
   }
   ```

3. **$sort**: Sorts documents in ascending or descending order.
   ```javascript
   { $sort: { sales: -1 } }  // Sort by sales in descending order
   ```

4. **$project**: Selects specific fields to include or exclude in the output documents.
   ```javascript
   { $project: { name: 1, sales: 1 } }  // Include only name and sales fields
   ```

5. **$limit**: Limits the number of documents returned.
   ```javascript
   { $limit: 5 }  // Return only the top 5 documents
   ```

6. **$lookup**: Performs a join between two collections, similar to SQL joins.
   ```javascript
   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "orders",  // Collection to join with
       localField: "_id",  // Field in the current collection
       foreignField: "customerId",  // Field in the "orders" collection
       as: "orderDetails"  // Output array field
     }
   }
   ```

---

### Example: Aggregation Pipeline

Suppose you have a collection of sales records and you want to find the total sales per product category, sorted by the highest total sales. Here's how the aggregation pipeline might look:

```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },  // Step 1: Filter by completed sales
  { $group: { _id: "$category", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } },  // Step 2: Group by category and calculate total sales
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } },  // Step 3: Sort by total sales in descending order
  { $limit: 5 }  // Step 4: Limit to top 5 categories
]);
```

### How it Works:
1. **$match** filters documents to include only those where `status` is "completed".
2. **$group** groups the documents by the `category` field and calculates the `totalSales` for each category.
3. **$sort** orders the results by `totalSales` in descending order.
4. **$limit** restricts the result to the top 5 categories.

---

### Use Cases of Aggregation:
- **Data analysis**: Summing up values, calculating averages, counting documents, etc.
- **Reporting**: Generating summaries of sales, orders, or any metrics.
- **Data transformation**: Reshaping documents, renaming fields, or combining data from multiple collections.

Aggregation in MongoDB is very flexible and powerful for handling large datasets and generating complex queries
