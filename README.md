You'll learn the basics of JavaScript syntax, data types, and how to write your first lines of code. Get ready to dive into the exciting world of web development with JavaScript as your guide!

### Basics : 
Break down of the core concepts of JavaScript in simple terms. You'll learn everything from variables and data types to loops and functions. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of the basics of JavaScript, setting you up for success as you dive deeper into web development. Let's unleash the power of JavaScript together!

### Asynchronous Javascript : 
In this lesson, we'll introduce you to the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We'll explore why it's important and how it can make your programs more efficient. Get ready to learn about asynchronous functions, callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. By understanding asynchronous JavaScript, you'll be able to create dynamic and responsive web applications. Let's dive in and start mastering asynchronous programming!

# How Internet Works.

## Basics 

In this lesson, we'll take a deep dive into the fascinating world of the internet. We'll explore how data travels across the globe, from your device to servers and back again. You'll learn about protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, which form the backbone of the internet. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of the infrastructure that powers the internet and how information is transmitted between devices. Let's unravel the mysteries of the internet together!

### How Internet Works ? 
The internet connects devices worldwide through a network of cables and servers. When you request a webpage, your device sends data to your <mark>Internet Service Provider (ISP) </mark>, which then routes it to the server hosting the page. The server sends the data back, and your device displays the webpage. This happens quickly, enabling global communication.
### Understanding IP Address ?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to each device on the internet. It works like a home address, telling other devices where to send data, such as websites or emails. Each device needs an IP address to communicate and share information online.(IP is provided by the ISP)

### What is MAC Address ? 
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network hardware, like a Wi-Fi card or Ethernet adapter. Think of it as a serial number for your device's internet connection hardware. When devices communicate within a local network, the MAC address helps ensure that the information goes to the correct device. Unlike IP addresses, which can change, MAC addresses are usually fixed and assigned by the manufacturer.

### Understanding VPN 
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, creates a secure connection between your device and the internet. It works by routing your internet traffic through a private server, hiding your real IP address and encrypting your data. This makes your online activities more private and secure, protecting you from hackers and allowing you to access content that might be restricted in your location. Essentially, a VPN acts like a secure tunnel for your internet traffic.

## More Information 

In this lesson, we'll simplify what reverse proxies are and how they work. Think of a reverse proxy as a shield that stands between the internet and your web servers, protecting them from direct access. We'll explore how reverse proxies enhance security, improve performance, and streamline network traffic. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of how reverse proxies can benefit your online infrastructure. Let's dive in and uncover the secrets of reverse proxies together!

### Proxy
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your internet requests go to the proxy server first, which then forwards them to the target website. The website's response goes back to the proxy, which sends it to you. This process hides your IP address, making your online activity more private and allowing you to access blocked or restricted content. Proxies can also improve security and manage network traffic.

### Reverse Proxy 
A reverse proxy sits between the internet and a server, acting as a middleman for incoming requests. When someone tries to access a website, the reverse proxy receives the request first, then forwards it to the appropriate server. It then sends the server's response back to the user. This helps balance the load among multiple servers, improves security by hiding the server's identity, and can cache content to speed up access for users. Essentially, a reverse proxy manages and protects server resources while providing efficient user access.

### Internet Protocols 
Internet protocols are rules and standards that allow devices to communicate over the internet. They ensure data is sent and received correctly between devices. Common protocols include HTTP for accessing websites, FTP for transferring files, and TCP/IP, which ensures data is properly routed and reaches its destination. These protocols work together to enable seamless and reliable communication across the global internet.

### ISP (Internet Service Provider)
An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company that provides you with access to the internet. When you connect to the internet from home or on your mobile device, your ISP routes your data to and from websites and online services. They manage your internet connection, handle network traffic, and offer various services like email and web hosting. Without an ISP, you wouldn't be able to connect to the internet.

### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, and it is the foundation of internet communication. TCP ensures that data is sent and received accurately by breaking it into packets and reassembling it at the destination. IP handles addressing and routing these packets to the correct destination. Together, TCP/IP makes sure that data travels efficiently and reliably between devices across networks, enabling everything from web browsing to email to online streaming.

### UDP -(User Datagram Protocol)
UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a communication method used on the internet. Unlike TCP, UDP sends data without establishing a connection or checking for errors. This makes it faster but less reliable, as data packets can be lost or arrive out of order. UDP is ideal for applications where speed is crucial and some data loss is acceptable, like live video streaming, online gaming, and voice calls.
