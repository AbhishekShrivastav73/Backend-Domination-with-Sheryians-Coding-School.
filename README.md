Getting Start with Back-End Journey with Sheryians Coding Schools (Back-End Domination : Create Efficient Back-End.).

# Javascript WarmUp
In this Section, we'll introduce you to the fascinating world of JavaScript, the language that powers much of the web. You'll learn the basics of JavaScript syntax, data types, and how to write your first lines of code. Get ready to dive into the exciting world of web development with JavaScript as your guide!

### Basics : 
Break down of the core concepts of JavaScript in simple terms. You'll learn everything from variables and data types to loops and functions. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of the basics of JavaScript, setting you up for success as you dive deeper into web development. Let's unleash the power of JavaScript together!

### Asynchronous Javascript : 
In this lesson, we'll introduce you to the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We'll explore why it's important and how it can make your programs more efficient. Get ready to learn about asynchronous functions, callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. By understanding asynchronous JavaScript, you'll be able to create dynamic and responsive web applications. Let's dive in and start mastering asynchronous programming!

# How Internet Works.

### Basics 

In this lesson, we'll take a deep dive into the fascinating world of the internet. We'll explore how data travels across the globe, from your device to servers and back again. You'll learn about protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, which form the backbone of the internet. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of the infrastructure that powers the internet and how information is transmitted between devices. Let's unravel the mysteries of the internet together!

### How Internet Works ? 
The internet connects devices worldwide through a network of cables and servers. When you request a webpage, your device sends data to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), which then routes it to the server hosting the page. The server sends the data back, and your device displays the webpage. This happens quickly, enabling global communication.
### Understanding IP Address ?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to each device on the internet. It works like a home address, telling other devices where to send data, such as websites or emails. Each device needs an IP address to communicate and share information online.

### What is MAC Address ? 
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network hardware, like a Wi-Fi card or Ethernet adapter. Think of it as a serial number for your device's internet connection hardware. When devices communicate within a local network, the MAC address helps ensure that the information goes to the correct device. Unlike IP addresses, which can change, MAC addresses are usually fixed and assigned by the manufacturer.

### More Information 

In this lesson, we'll simplify what reverse proxies are and how they work. Think of a reverse proxy as a shield that stands between the internet and your web servers, protecting them from direct access. We'll explore how reverse proxies enhance security, improve performance, and streamline network traffic. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a clear understanding of how reverse proxies can benefit your online infrastructure. Let's dive in and uncover the secrets of reverse proxies together!
